Hi guys,
I've gone to China, and I'll miss you.

Here is the push, which I believe is up to date.  As for Heroku, 
the easiest thing to do was to delete the Shamango project directory.
Now you are free to create and control it.  I doubt anyone will snatch up
shamango between now when I've deleted it and when you will create it.

Take care,
D
